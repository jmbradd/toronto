# That Totally Happened
This is one of my portfolio projects.  I decided to take a different approach this time and go after a game.  I felt I had been stuck making MEANish applications so I decided to go mostly websockets on this one.  It's been a really fun project to write because it's event based and I think of all the projects I am doing for my portfolio, it's going to be the one I keep working on the most.

#The Game
It's a trivia game with a bit of a twist.  It's basically a mix of you don't know jack and balderdash.  Players are presented with a statement of fact and they are tasked with determining it's veracity.  They interact with a game show host who treats them differently according to their history in the game.

#Modes
I'm currently working on three modes: democracy, autocracy and consesnsus.

Democracy

Each player on the team has a vote and the option with the most votes wins and is submitted as the teams answer.

Autocracy

Each player can vote but only the team captain's answer is submitted

Consensus

The team has to all submit the same answer before it will be evaluated by the game.  Preference will be given to teams that answer quicker.

There is a LONG road to go with this: the game is barely functioning right now.  That said, it's an interesting blend of technologies and I love the potential host AI I am working on.  Through this I hope to learn how to use Mongo to track the path of each player, question and game format.  I really want this game to adapt to how the player based responds by analyzing response data and adjusting difficulty rating for questions and player quality rating for players.

Please follow this project if you're interested in seeing what might become of this game or even myself as a developer.

Thank you!
